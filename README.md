# code-quiz

# Information

This week's project is a code quiz, which we must create from scratch. A user is provided with questions, and they must choose one of the options to proceed. Each incorrect response will subtract time from the original 100 seconds. The start button starts a 100-second timer and displays a list of multiple-choice questions that changes as the user clicks. The goal of creating this app is to practise fundamental developer skills like traversing the DOM, adding event listeners, and setting up and accessing local storage, among others.

# problems

This homework was exceedingly challenging and had a great deal of complexity. The most challenging step is attempting to save the page's high score section.
